# udacity

This project houses a few key parts.

1) A csv file of Airbnb listing in Seattle.
2) A json file of Seattle zipcodes needed to map a choropleth map.
3) A python file that creates three visualization to answer three questions about the dataset. 

These files are used to make a blog post intended to share questions and insights from the dataset with a non-technical audience.
