## Project Motivation

These files are used to make a blog post intended to share questions and insights from the dataset with a non-technical audience. The goal of this project was to pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

The three questions are:
1) What zipcode has the most expensive airbnbs?
2) What type of airbnb gets the most reviews?
3) How does the number of guests an airbnb can accomodate relate to price?

## File Descriptions

1) A csv file of Airbnb listing in Seattle.
2) A json file of Seattle zipcodes needed to map a choropleth map.
3) A python file that creates three visualization to answer three questions about the dataset. 
4) The three visualizations output from the python script as png files. 

## How to Interact

Run the python file to generate visualizations. Visualizations and blog post can be found in the markdown file.
