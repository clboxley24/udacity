### Introduction

Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is home a number of performing arts, musical artists, and spoken word slammers. Outdoors, visitors can find plenty of parks to explore, trails to hike, and watersports to enjoy. 

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects property owners willing to rent their space with renters looking for short-term rentals -- primarily for vacations and tourism. In most major cities, renters can find a variety of properties such as apartments, single-family homes, and detached guest suites. 

And Seattle, Washington is no exception. If you are looking to visit Seattle and new to airbnb, continue reading for a quick introduction to finding a place to stay during your trip.

### How does the rental property's price change compared to how many guests it can accommodate?

No surprise -- just like almost everything in life, the more you want to buy, the more you have to pay. If you need a larger space to accommodate more visitors, you'll end up paying more for the rental. However, the price per guest actually goes DOWN as you look at larger spaces. If your party is splitting housing costs evenly, it might make sense to bring as many people as you can.

###### The total price for larger properties is more expensive BUT cheaper per guest.

### What type of rental property has the most reviews?

Reviews are an important part of finding the right rental property. If you're looking for a property with the most reviews consider properties outside of the box such as yurts, campers, cabins, and lofts. Standard properties like townhouses, apartments, and houses have relatively middling numbers of reviews.

###### Unique properties like yurts, campers, cabins, and lofts are most often reviewed.

### Where in Seattle are rental properties most expensive?

Generally, properties in zipcodes surrounding the water tend to be a little more expensive, so if you want a rental near the water, you are going to pay a premium. Zipcodes that encompass downtown Seattle, uptown Seattle, and west Seattle tend to cost a little more than rentals in South Seattle, so if you want to be near the tourist-y spots, you'll have to pay a little more for the convenience.
